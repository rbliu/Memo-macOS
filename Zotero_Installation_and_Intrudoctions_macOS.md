Environment: Mac OS X 10.11, 64-bit/ Chrome 50.0/ Zotero 4.0

* First, of course, download the app from:

https://www.zotero.org/download/

If you are using firefox, go ahead with "Zotero for Firefox". If you are a Chrome person like me, choose "Zotero Standalone". Don't forget to add the Chrome extension.
